// to return all songs and display them: ajax call to return links to all the songs
actions for how to change redux store based on it
reducers for (add user reducer, so current user is an id that points to that slice of state)
  songs reducer adds all songs to current state,
    it adds all the songs I'm trying to display on the page to state, or when I'm
    displaying albums, it'd be displaying albums, etc.


notes for playlists:

both home / player should be able to change the current song
player will hold a "currentQueue" and a "songCollection"

currentSong will live in redux store
SongCollection will live in redux store
currentQueue will be in the player component,
  currentQueue uses the collection to generate a list of future songs to play
Can also view a collection WITHOUT updating the collection

    Can be album or playlist
    player can jump to next song or prev song
    home can change current song
      but when it does, that updates the songCollection as well, because can't
      change song without changing collection
        even if its the same, just update it as if its different anyway.
      which triggers the player to update their current-queue

      some player methods to use:
      <ReactPlayer
        ref={ this.ref }
        url={ currentSongUrl }
        playing={ this.state.isPlaying }
        volume= { this.state.volume }
        onEnded={ this.handleNext }
        onStart={ this.setCurrentSong }
        onProgress={ this.setProgress }
        onDuration={duration => this.setState({ duration }) }


        goals for wed:
        thoughts going on:
          I think its broken because there are 2 albums in the store
          there shouldn't be....

        CURRENT questions:
          can you have 2 onClicks in the same button?
            or 1 clickHandler that calls both functions?
          Getting the home to properly link
          updating the current song from the album_show page
